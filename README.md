# FashionMNIST_TensorFlow
In this notebook, I build a classification model on the FashionMNIST dataset available in Keras. 

I achieve an accuracy of 97% on my model, but accuracy is not the best measure of classification models. However, I have also plotted the images along with their labels and prediction confidence to get an idea of my models performance.
